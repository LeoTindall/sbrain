//! ## What is SBrain?
//!   SBrain, or Semantic Brain, is a language based on Urban MÃ¼ller's famous language with only 8 symbols (3 bit instructions). SBrain's additions increase the number of symbols to 32 (6 bit instructions) and adds a stack and a register.
//!
//! ## Specification
//! ### Data Structures
//!   SBrain requires:
//!
//! * a read/write tape datastructure ("data tape") which is addressable up to, at minimum, 65,536 (0x0 - 0xFFFF) 32-bit cells. Not all of these must be active in memory; however, SBrain programs may assume that they are all addressable. They must be initially set to zero unless set with an initialization instruction.
//! * a read/write stack (FILO) datastructure ("data stack") which must support, at minimum, 256 values. Not all of these must be active in memory; however, SBrain programs may assume that they are addressable. They must be initially set to zero.
//! * a read/write stack (FILO) datastructure ("jump stack") which must support, at minimum, 256 values large enough to store an address on the data tape.
//! * a read-only tape datastructure which contains the executable code. This code is represented as a list of unsigned integers of, at minimum, six bits in width.
//! * a read-only nonreversable tape containing the program's input (note: as this tape is nonreversable and nonwriteable, a function like C's getch() works fine.)
//! * a write-only nonreversable tape containing the program's output (note: as this tape is nonreversable and nonreadable, a function like C's putch() works fine.)
//! * a read/write register (`data_p`) of enough bits to store a position on the data tape
//! * a read/write register (`inst_p`) of enough bits to store a position on the instruction tape
//! * a read/write register (`jump_p`) of enough bits to store a position on the instruction tape
//! * a read/write register (`auxi_r`) of the same size as a cell on the data tape
//!
//! ### Commands and Source Code
//!
//! SBrain source code consists of text characters. Executable code consists of unsigned integers of six bits. A transliterator converts the source code to executable code by a one-to-one mapping, with two exceptions. The first is noted in the entry for instruction 31 (@), which is a metacharacter in certain circumstances. The second is the comment character, #. All data between # characters, including those characters, is ignored by the transliterator.
//!
//! The first eight instructions are the standard brainf--- instructions. **Any brainf--- program is a valid SBrain program and should behave in the same way as in a standard, semantically equivalent brainf--- interpreter.**
//!
//! Decimal | Code  | Semantics
//! --------|-------|----------
//!        0|      <|Decrement `data_p`
//!        1|      >|Increment `data_p`
//!        2|      -|Subtract one from the cell pointed at by `data_p`
//!        3|      +|Add one to the cell pointed at by `data_p`
//!        4|      [|Set `jump_p` to the current position, push `jump_p` to the jump stack, and, if the cell pointed at by `data_p` is zero, cease evaluating instructions until `inst_p` points at the corresponding 5 (`]`).
//!        5|      ]|Pop an address from the jump stack into `jump_p`. If the jump stack is empty, set `jump_p` to the current `inst_p` + 1 instead (making this a NOP). Set `inst_p` to `jump_p` if the cell pointed at by `data_p` is nonzero.
//!        6|      .|Place the value in the cell pointed at by `data_p` on the output tape
//!        7|      ,|Place the next value from the input tape in the cell pointed at by `data_p`
//!        8|      {|Push the value from the cell pointed at by `data_p` onto the stack
//!        9|      }|Pop the next value from the stack into the cell pointed at by `data_p`
//!       10|      (|Set `auxi_r` to the value of the cell pointed at by `data_p`
//!       11|      )|Set the cell pointed at by `data_p` to the value in `auxi_r`
//!       12|      z|Set the value in `auxi_r` to 0
//!       13|      !|Perform a bitwise NOT on the value in `auxi_r`.
//!       14|      s|Perform a bitshift to the left on the value in `auxi_r`. Bits shifted off the left are lost, and bits shifted in from the right are always zero. (E.g. 11111101 -> 11111010)
//!       15|      S|Perform a bitshift to the right on the value in `auxi_r`. Bits shifted off the right are lost, and bits shifted in from the left are always zero. (E.g. 11111101 -> 01111101)
//!       31|      @|End the program. The exit code is the value in `auxi_r`. If repeated twice (@@) in the source code, the transliterator will consider all further source code to be data and will use it to initialize the data tape.
//!
//! The following instructions are separated because they all follow similar rules. Each one performs an operation on the value at the cell pointed to by `data_p` (`a`) and the value in `auxi_r`(`b`), in that order if the operation is not commutative, storing it in the cell pointed at by `data_p`. The creation of a value in a cell greater than the maximum value able to be held by that cell shall result in a wraparound (e.g. 0xFFFFFFFF + 0b11 = 0b11)
//!
//! Decimal | Code  | Semantics
//! --------|-------|----------
//!       16|     \|| a OR b (bitwise)
//!       17|      &| a AND b (bitwise)
//!       18|      *| a XOR b (bitwise)
//!       19|      ^| a NOR b (bitwise)
//!       20|      $| a NAND b (bitwise)
//!       21|      a| ADD of a and b
//!       22|      d| DIFFERENCE of a and b
//!       23|      q| QUOTIENT of a and b (a divided by b)
//!       24|      m| a MODULO b
//!       25|      p| PRODUCT of a and b (a multiplied by b)
//!
//!
//! ### Further Rules
//! No read operation shall ever disrupt a cell on the data tape.
//! Reading an EOF always produces a 0.
//! Non-command characters in the instruction section of source code must be ignored.
