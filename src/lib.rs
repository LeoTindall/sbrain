//! SBrain, or Semantic Brain, is a set of extensions to the famous language by Urban MÃ¼ller
//! designed to make it more amenable to genetic programming. Additions include a stack, a general-
//! purpose register, and single-instruction arithmetic.
//!
//! This crate provides an implementation of the SBrain specification designed to be used for
//! genetic programming. See the `specification` pseudomodule for the complete specification.
